In this template file, there are three valid dockets/jobs. Docket 123 has 6 codes, Docket 125 has 6 codes and Docket 127 has 2 codes.
Numbers 124 and 126 are ignored because 124 has no codes in it, and 126 has a space directly after the Docket line.
The program will look for the codes XYZ50 and XYZ60 when creating the worksheet for "Docket 127".
These lines above the line "Docket 123" will be ignored.
